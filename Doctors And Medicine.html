<h2>DOCTORS!!!</h2>
<p>Ohhhh boyyy doctors were pretty scary back then, they were known as the Plague Doctors and I'm pretty sure they weren't Doctors. The doctors would examine the patients blood and compare it to the 4 parts of the universe, Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. There were also 5 types of doctors back then.</p>
<p> - Middle Ages Physcians</p>
<p> - Middle Ages Surgeons</p>
<p> - Middle Ages Barbers</p>
<p> - Middle Ages Apocothocary</p>
<p> - Middle Ages 'Wise Woman'</p>


<h2> MEDICINE!!! </h2>
<p>Not many people knew what had caused such illness's to occur, the Catholic Church said that it was because of sinful behaviour. The medicine used to treat diseases and sicknesse's were made from herbs, spices, and resins, these medicines were applied in many forms such as baths, drinks, pills, washes, rubs, poultices, purges and ointments. For the Black Death however, only 30-40% of people would survive so the doctors decided to apply a warm poultice of butter, onion, and garlic on the buboes that appeared on the body.</p>
