     <h2> About Knights and Kings </h2>
    <p>Knights and Kings were very disciplined. When it came to battle, they were ruthless, brutal and heavily armoured. There were actually 3 types of Knights back then, Foot Soldiers, Archers and Knights.</p>

    <p>Foot Soldiers:
      Foot Soldiers weren't as different from knights as you would seem, their primary goal in battle was to charge at the enemy on foot and protect the Knights who were mounted on their horses but there will be more info on regular Knights after.Most of the Foot Soldiers back then were  unexperienced peasants who were forced to fight for their king, luckily by the 15th century they were well trained, well disciplined and had well listening skills.</p>

    <p>Archer:
      The Archer (otherwise known as the Bowman) was skilled with bows and arrows. Every archer was supposed to have good accuracy and hand-eye coordination,this did not go to waste in battle as their formation was to point their bows up to the sky and fire arrows above the enemy to make it seems it was raining arrows, this did an exstensive amount of damage to those Knights without shields or Armour. There were other types of archers aswell, the longbowman and the crossbowman, but we won't get into too much detailwith those as their names give away their roles in battle.

    <p>Knights: These regular old Knights were very noble, brave and loyal to their King. In battle they would ride on horses holding a sword in 1 hand and a shield in the other to defend and attack. These Knights would sometimes run into battle on foot witht the Foot Soldiers. Their armour was expensive, but yet strong and helpful.</p>

    <p>Kings: Kings were considered the way presidents are considered today but there are things that kings do that presidents don't. Kings back then weren't as reasoable as you would think, they were very important and were very demanding. Kings had the power of everything including Armies, Sentencing, Peasants and Medicine. In terms of villages, he was the one who could do anything to it without a thought or regret, in this case power + greed + fortune + selfishness = King in Medieval Times.
