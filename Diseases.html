<h2>DISEASES!!!</h2>
<p>So diseases aren't all that fun, except they are pretty interesting when it comes to Medieval History. The Black Plague was the main disease back then, it was also known as the Zombie disease but there will be more info on that in the next paragraph. In families, if someone were to be infected by any disease that was fatal, they would immediately be killed so the disease wouldn't be spread around. </p>

<h2> THE BLACK PLAGUE!!! </h2>
<p> The Zombie Disease was pretty scary back then, it was usually contracted from black rats which would spend their time near sewers and all sorts of dirty places. The average time for a person to pass away from the disease is 23 days which is pretty fast. In the early 1340's the disease spread around India, China, Persia, Syria and Egypt. Some of the symptoms of the disease were abdominal pain, fever, weakness, chills and shock.</p>
