<h2>Whats This About?</h2>
<p>So this website will cover mainly everything important that has got to do with Medieval History, There will be such things like The Plague Doctor, and the Black Plague and much more fun things to look at. This is an assignment so there won't be much effort put into this, but it still is helpful. </p>
<h2> A little about me </h2>
<p> I am a year 10 IST (Information Software Technology) student who had to make a website as an assignment so I thought waht the most fun thing I had learnt in all of my time in School that I completely understood and was easy to explain....MEDIEVAL HISTORY!!! (It was that or Feudal Japan so yeah)</p>
