  <h2>About Communities</h2>
  <p>In Medieval Times Communities lived in villages, families would rely on eachother for food and warmth. Things were rough back then, people who lived in communities were known as <b><a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?client=safari&channel=mac_bm&source=hp&q=peasants&oq=pesants&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i10k1l4.5629.10911.0.12080.20.13.6.0.0.0.381.2191.0j2j6j1.9.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..6.14.2053.0..0j0j0i67k1j35i39k1.dq6C9a7uLIs">peasants</a></b> to the rich. A normal peasant would have to work on the kings land, they would harvest and plough crops, their daily life would start at 3am and they would eat pottage for breakfast. Not only harvesting and ploughing were their jobs but they would also do reaping, sowing, hay making, threshing and more.</p>

<p>Generally people in Communties would make their own food and produce at home, they rather did this than risk the uncerntainty of trade. Not only did they make food but they also made their own clothes out of flax, leather and wool. There would be a village mill, this is where they would be able to aquire such things as meal, flour, iron, and various tools.</p>
